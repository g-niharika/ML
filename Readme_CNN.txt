README: CNN Models for CIFAR-10 Classification
Project Overview
-----------------
This project presents three distinct Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models designed for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The primary objective of this work is to explore the impact of network depth and regularization techniques on model performance. Each model was trained and evaluated using the CIFAR-10 dataset, a widely used benchmark for image classification.

Dataset: CIFAR-10
CIFAR-10 is a dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, with the classes including: airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.

Models
-------
Three different CNN architectures were tested, and their results are presented below:

Model 1: Baseline CNN
Architecture: 2 Convolutional Layers
Details: This model uses two convolutional layers with ReLU activation, followed by a max-pooling layer.
Performance: Achieved a testing accuracy of 68.11%.
Model 2: Deepened CNN
Architecture: 5 Convolutional Layers
Details: The number of convolutional layers was increased to five, leading to a more complex feature extraction.
Performance: The model achieved a testing accuracy of 78.45%, representing an improvement of approximately 10-11% compared to Model 1.
Model 3: Deep CNN with Regularization
Architecture: 6 Convolutional Layers + Dropout
Details: An additional convolutional layer was added, along with a dropout layer for regularization to prevent overfitting.
Performance: Achieved the highest testing accuracy of 83.66%.
